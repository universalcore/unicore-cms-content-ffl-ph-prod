Emergencies that make people flee their homes often lead to the spread of communicable diseases. As a first priority, all displaced children under 15 years of age should be immediately immunized, especially for measles, at the first point of contact or settlement. Measles is even more serious when children are malnourished or living in conditions of poor sanitation. If a child\u2019s vaccination record is lost and the parents do not remember which vaccines the child has received, it is safe to repeat doses.\r\n\r\n",
