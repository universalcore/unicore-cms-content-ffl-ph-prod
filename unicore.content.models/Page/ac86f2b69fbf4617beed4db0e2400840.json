  "content": "By observing how young children respond to touch, sound and sight, parents can identify signs of possible developmental problems or disabilities. If a young child is developing slowly, it may help to spend extra time playing and talking with the child, even massaging the child\u2019s body. If the child does not respond to attention and stimulation, there may be a need to seek help from trained health workers. Taking early action is very important to help children with delays and disabilities reach their full potential. But like all children, children with disabilities should be encouraged to play and interact with other children.\r\n\r\n",
