  "content": "A child\u2019s brain develops rapidly during the first five years of life, especially the first three years. It is a time of rapid cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional and emotional development.\r\n\r\nEach time the child uses one of the senses, a neural connection is made in the child\u2019s brain. New experiences repeated many times help make new connections, which shape the way the child thinks, feels, behaves and learns throughout life.\r\n\r\nBabies need a lot of care and affection in the early years. Holding, cuddling, and talking to the child stimulate brain growth and promote emotional development. Being kept close to the mother and breastfeeding on demand provide the infant with a sense of emotional security.\r\n\r\nFor young children, crying is a way of communicating. Responding to the child\u2019s cry by holding and/or talking soothingly to her or him will help establish a sense of trust and security.\r\n\r\nThis early bonding and attachment to the mother and father helps a child develop a broad range of abilities he can use throughout life, including the ability to learn, be self confident and have high self-esteem, have positive social skills, have successful relationships at later ages, and develop a sense of empathy.\r\n\r\nAs children\u2019s brains develop, so do their emotions, which are real and powerful. Children may become frustrated if they are unable to do something or have something they want. They are often frightened of strangers, new situations or the dark. Children whose reactions are laughed at, punished or ignored may grow up shy and unable to express emotions normally. If parents and caregivers are patient and sympathetic when a child expresses strong emotions, the child is more likely to grow up happy, secure and well-balanced.\r\n\r\nYoung children can experience excessive stress if they are physically or emotionally punished, are exposed to violence, are neglected or abused, or live in families with mental illness such as depression or substance abuse.\r\n\r\nChildren who are physically or mentally punished in anger are more likely to become violent themselves. More positive and effective ways to address children\u2019s behavior can include providing a child with clear explanations about what to do and not to do, and praising good behavior.\r\n\r\n",
