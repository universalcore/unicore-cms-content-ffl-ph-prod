Their minds develop rapidly when they are talked to, touched and cuddled, when they see and hear familiar faces and voices, and when they handle different objects. Even if the child is not yet able to understand the words, early \u2018conversations\u2019 help to develop social and language skills and learning capacities.\r\n\r\nChildren who feel secure and loved usually do better in school, are more self confident, have good self-esteem and are able to cope more easily with life\u2019s challenges.\r\n",
