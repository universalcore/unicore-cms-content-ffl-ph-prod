Young children should be assisted when they are learning to feed themselves.\r\n\r\nIf a child refuses to eat a variety of foods, experiment with different food combinations, tastes, textures, and methods of encouragement. Minimize distractions during meals if the child loses interest in eating easily.\r\n\r\nGirls and boys require the same amount of attention and time for feeding.\r\n",
