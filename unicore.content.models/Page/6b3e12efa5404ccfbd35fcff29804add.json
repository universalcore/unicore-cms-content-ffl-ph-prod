  "content": "Children must be immunized early in life. It is essential for infants to get all recommended vaccines at the right time. Some vaccines require multiple doses for full protection. It is important for every child to complete the full number of these immunizations. To protect the child during and beyond the first year of life, the immunizations in the following chart are necessary. These are most effective when given at the ages specified, or as close to those ages as possible. If a child does not complete the full series of immunizations in the first two years of life, it is extremely important to have the child fully immunized as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAs new vaccines become available, more vaccines are recommended for all countries. But some vaccines are only needed in countries where certain diseases are present.\r\n\r\nParents and health practitioners should follow the locally recommended immunization schedule. In some countries like the Philippines, additional vaccine doses, called \u2018booster shots\u2019, are offered after the first year of life. These help sustain the effectiveness of the vaccines so the child is protected longer.\r\n\r\n",
