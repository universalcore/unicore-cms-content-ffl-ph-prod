  "content": "In the first six months, when a baby is most at risk, exclusive breastfeeding helps to protect against diarrhea and other common infections and gets the baby off to a good start in life.\r\n\r\nAt 6 months, the child needs other foods and drinks in addition to breastmilk. These provide energy, protein, vitamins and other nutrients needed to support growth and development.\r\n\r\nA variety of foods \u2013 vegetables and fruits, meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products \u2013 helps to meet the child\u2019s nutrition needs. Breastfeeding for up to two years and beyond provides an important source of nutrients that protect against diseases.\r\n\r\nIf soft, semi-solid or solid foods are introduced too late, the child may not be getting the necessary nutrients. This can slow down growth and development.\r\n\r\nWhen introducing solid foods, it is important to start with soft, mushy foods and move gradually to more solid foods. The greater the variety of healthy foods, the more balanced and nutritious the child\u2019s diet.\r\n\r\nThe consistency and variety of foods should be adapted to a child\u2019s requirements and eating abilities. At 6 months of age, infants can eat pureed or mashed foods, thick soups and porridges. By 8 months, most infants can also eat \u2018finger foods\u2019 (snacks that children can eat by themselves). By 12 months, most children can eat the same types of foods as the rest of the family.",
