  "content": "A lack of iron in the diet is a common cause of anemia. Iron deficiency can impair physical and mental development in infants and young children. Even mild iron deficiency can impair intellectual development. Anemia is the most common nutritional disorder in the world.\r\n\r\nFoods such as flour, fish sauce and soy sauce are sometimes fortified with iron. Iron-rich foods help prevent anemia. Consuming them with vitamin C helps the digestive system to better absorb the iron.",
