The vaccines work by building up the child\u2019s defenses against diseases. Immunization only works if given before the disease strikes.\r\n\r\nA child who is not immunized is very likely to get measles, whooping cough and many other diseases that can kill. Children who survive these diseases are weakened and may not grow well. They may be permanently disabled. They may die later from malnutrition and other illnesses.\r\n\r\n",
