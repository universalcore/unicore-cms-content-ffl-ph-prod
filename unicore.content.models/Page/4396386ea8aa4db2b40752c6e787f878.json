  "content": "In many parts of the world, including some areas in the Philippines, mothers still give\r\nbirth in unhygienic conditions. This puts both the mother and the child at risk of getting tetanus, a major killer of newborn infants. If a pregnant woman is not immunized against tetanus, and tetanus bacteria spores enter her body, her life will also be at risk.\r\n\r\nIt is safe for a pregnant woman to be immunized against tetanus. She should be immunized according to this schedule:\r\n\r\n**First dose:** As soon as she knows she is pregnant.\r\n**Second dose:** One month after the first dose, and no later than two weeks before her due date.\r\n**Third dose:** Six months to one year after the second dose, or during the next pregnancy.\r\n**Fourth dose:** One year after the third dose, or during a subsequent pregnancy.\r\n**Fifth dose:** One year after the fourth dose, or during a subsequent pregnancy.\r\n\r\nAfter five properly spaced doses, the mother is protected for life and her children are protected for the first few weeks of life against tetanus.\r\n",
