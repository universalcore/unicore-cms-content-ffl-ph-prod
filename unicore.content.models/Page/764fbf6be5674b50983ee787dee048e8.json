However, children\u2019s energy and body-building needs are great. It is important that children eat frequently to provide for all their needs.\r\n\r\nFoods such as mashed vegetables and chopped meat, eggs or fish should be added to the diet as often as possible. A small amount of oil may be added, preferably vitamin-enriched oil.",
